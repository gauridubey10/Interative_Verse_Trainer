## Description

The Interactive Training Verse application is a dynamic and engaging tool designed to facilitate interactive learning and memorization of various verses. With a user-friendly interface, this application incorporates gamified elements to make the learning experience enjoyable and effective.

## Key Features

* Versatility: The application encompasses a wide range of verses from different sources, allowing users to choose verses based on their preferences or learning goals.

* Interactive Levels: Users can embark on a progressive learning journey through multiple levels. At each level, a verse is presented, and the challenge begins.

* Start Button: Clicking the "Start" button initiates the learning process. Users are prompted to focus on memorizing the verse as it appears in its entirety.

* Letter Hiding: As users advance through different levels, a random selection of letters from the displayed verse is strategically hidden. This challenges users to recall and complete the missing portions of the verse.

* Show Hint Button: For assistance, users can utilize the "Show Hint" button to reveal a hint for the hidden letters. This feature is especially helpful for users facing difficulty in memorization.
* Previous Button: Previous button empowers users to backtrack to level 1.
